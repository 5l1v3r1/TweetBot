# TweetBot
This is A Simple TweetBot to Make Tweets

## Uses
I am sharing this Bot That I used in A Tweet Competition that I Won xD.

This Bot Can Work in CLI Mode Without Selenium
It automates a command line browser called 'lynx'

This does not need Twitter API To Work.
You Can Simply Do By Put Your Account Creds.

This Can be run in Android By Termux

### How To Run 

```python tweetbot.py```

This Prevents You From Being Detected As Bot By Doing Human Like interaction And Random Delays.

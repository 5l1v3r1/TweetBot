# TweetBot
This is A Simple TweetBot to Make Tweets

## Uses
I am sharing this Bot That I used in A Tweet Competition that I Won xD.

This Bot Can Work in CLI Mode Without Selenium
It automates a command line browser called 'lynx'

This does not need Twitter API To Work.
You Can Simply Do By Put Your Account Creds.

This Can be run in Android By Termux

## Requirements
This Bot Was Made Keeping Speed And Resource Usage in Mind.  <br>
So it uses least of requirements.  <br>
lynx   <br>
```apt install lynx```   <br>
python3  <br>
```apt install python```

This uses lynx as a commandline browser.  <br>
So You dont even need Any GUI Browser To Make it Work.

### How To Run 

```python tweetbot.py```

This Prevents You From Being Detected As Bot By Doing Human Like interaction And Random Delays.
